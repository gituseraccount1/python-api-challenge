# python-api-challenge
There are two parts to this challenge:
1) WeatherPy: We all know the temperature increases as we get closer to the equator. We are using data from OpenWeatherMap API to show our analysis of this with scatter plots of temperature: 
	1) Latitude vs. Temperature
	2) Latitude vs. Humidity
	3) Latitude vs. Cloudiness
	4) Latitude vs. Wind Speed

2) VacationPy: We are planning future vacations and looking at weather data for those different locations we are interested in. We will use the Geoapify API and geoViews. We are going to create visitations of the places we want to go.
